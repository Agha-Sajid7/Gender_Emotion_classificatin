##Emotion and Gender Prediction Using Deep Learning
This project combines emotion prediction and gender prediction tasks using deep learning techniques. It leverages the powerful VGG16 architecture to classify images into respective emotion and gender categories.

#Overview
The project aims to address two significant challenges in computer vision:

#Emotion Prediction:
Predicting human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from facial expressions.
Gender Prediction: Determining the gender of a person based on facial features.
These tasks have various applications, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, targeted advertising, and demographic studies.

#Datasets Used
Emotion Prediction: FANE Dataset
Dataset is split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.
Gender Prediction: UTK Dataset
Dataset is split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.

#Key Features
Utilized VGG16, a pretrained deep learning model, for feature extraction and classification.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters and optimized the model on both datasets.

#Achieved:
**50%** accuracy in emotion prediction.
**80%** accuracy in gender prediction
Highlighted strengths and limitations of the VGG16 architecture for these tasks.

#Future Improvements
Experiment with alternative architectures like ResNet or custom models.
Use data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
Employ ensemble methods for enhanced accuracy.

This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning in dual-task prediction while identifying areas for further research and optimization.
